The function "LR_int()" in A.1 finds the left and right end points that contain the event time, provided the event takes place.
The function "data_int()" in A.2 generates synthetic data to test the performance of our proposed model.
The function "em.svm()" in A.3 is the SVM-based expectation maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters and different quantities of interest.
The function "smcure.Int" in A.4 estimates the parametric mixture cure rate model.
